A simple runner about running out of space.
Try to stay alive for as long as possible, avoid your own trail!.

My compo submission to Ludum Dare 42 “Running out of space”

As soon as I’ve heard the theme an image flashed in my head - it’s a game where you are in space, 
trying to run out of it while you are running out of space. 
That was the key to my design which I tried to keep following.
